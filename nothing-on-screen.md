# I've plugged my Raspberry Pi in, but nothing is appearing on the screen. What's wrong?

It is important that you connect your cables in the correct order, ensuring that the HDMI cable is plugged in before the power. You can follow our hardware guides in this help section of the website if you are not sure of the order:

Also, please make sure that your screen is turned on and you have the correct input selected **before** you plug in the power for your Raspberry Pi.
