# 8. I've copied NOOBS to an SD card, but it gets stuck on the splash screen. What should I do?

If NOOBS won't load once you have copied the files over, it may be that you have a corrupt SD card. If you've tried a different SD card and NOOBS still doesn't work, then you might want to try installing Raspbian directly. Follow the guide [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/help-software-guide/quickstart) for instructions.
