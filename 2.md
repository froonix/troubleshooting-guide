# 2. Where can I buy a Raspberry Pi and how much does it cost?

You can buy a Raspberry Pi from our main distributors, [Premier Farnell/Element14](https://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi) and [RS Components/Allied Electronics](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=raspberrypi). Both distributors sell all over the world. There are also many resellers of Raspberry Pis, both online and in bricks-and-mortar stores.
